# Sales-Funnel-Analysis-Conversion-Optimization-Financial-impact
This project presents my in-depth analysis of an e-commerce platform's sales funnel, aimed at identifying the factors that impact customer engagement, conversion rates, and retention. By integrating Python for data analysis, SQL for efficient querying, and Power BI for visualization, I was able to uncover key insights and develop data-driven recommendations. These insights are designed to optimize conversion paths, enhance customer satisfaction, and ultimately boost revenue.

### Business Problem
With a significant portion of customers abandoning orders mid-process, the main business problem is improving the conversion rate across the e-commerce platform’s sales funnel. Specific objectives include:

•	Pinpointing customer drop-off stages within the purchase journey.

•	Understanding key factors influencing conversion such as order reviews, delivery times, and payment methods.

•	Enhancing the customer journey to maximize engagement, minimize friction, and increase order completion rates.

### Methodology:
Used SQL queries to extract and clean relevant order, review, and marketing data from the e-commerce database.

Built a Power BI dashboard to track order status, conversion rates, and other funnel metrics.

Conducted detailed funnel analysis in Python to simulate changes and optimize conversion opportunities.
